      <h4 class='no-margin'>Recommendation #2:</h4> Align the Zoning Code with
      the Future Land Use Plan.
    content: >-
      The primary function of the Future Land Use Plan is to guide and inform
      zoning practices in the City.  The Future Land Use Plan ensures that
      zoning decisions that are made by the City align with the communityâ€™s
      vision, as expressed in the master plan of the City (SA Tomorrow and the
      Brooks Area Regional Center Plan).  Once a future land use plan is
      adopted, the zoning code must align with the future land use plan It is
      not, however, a direct translation, as there are multiple zoning districts
      that are applicable within each land use category.  The land use
      categories allow for a range of zoning districts which are generally
      complementary, to avoid conflicts between adjacent uses, to preserve
      property values, and to give clearer definition to the spaces within the
      community. The City Planning Department will oversee alignment of the
      Zoning Code with the Future Land Use Plan.

      <h4 class='no-margin'>Recommendation #3:</h4> Promote Trail-oriented
      development and connectivity to natural assets.
    content: >-
      The Brooks Area Regional Center is adjacent to Mission Reach, and to the
      San Antonio River.  These two cultural and natural assets should to be
      accessible to the community of the Brooks Area Regional Center.  Salado
      Creek runs parallel to the San Antonio River on the east side of the
      Brooks Area and should be recognized as a natural asset that should be
      connected and used. Additionally, this area is characterized by beautiful
      topography and riparian areas, which should be used not only for
      recreation, but as the site of park-and trail-oriented development as
      envisioned in the <a href='https://sacompplan.com/place-types/'
      target='_blank'>SA Tomorrow Comprehensive Plan</a>. Land uses on adjacent
      properties should capture the potential provided by these natural assets,
      while minimizing the impact that development can have on environmentally
      sensitive areas.

      <h4 class='no-margin'>Recommendation #4:</h4> Respect and respond to
      topography and geographic constraints when planning new development and
      public improvements.
    content: >-
      The Brooks Area includes significant topography and other geographic
      features that have historically not been adequately addressed by
      development. When development regulations do not adequately account for
      storm water runoff, the rains that are characteristic of the San Antonio
      area can have a detrimental impact on neighboring properties. 
      Furthermore, topographic and geographic features, such as floodplains and
      steep slopes, can make development more complicated and costly. Measures
      that respond to these natural constraints and actively minimize the
      negative impact of development on natural systems are needed in the Brooks
      Area Regional Center.

      <h4 class='no-margin'>Recommendation #5:</h4> Encourage business
      retention, commercial property stability and adaptive re-use where
      appropriate.
    content: >-
      Many of the commercial areas in the Brooks Area Regional Center are
      aging.  This makes them vulnerable to decline and displacement if land use
      measures are not in place to encourage business retention, property
      maintenance, renovation and adaptive re-use.  Maintaining existing
      businesses and commercial areas promotes stability in property values for
      the area and ensures adequate commercial and employment accessibility for
      the surrounding neighborhoods. Encouraging and supporting higher-intensity
      development and a mix of uses through Mixed-Use land use designations can
      support these goals. Measures that accommodate revitalization efforts and
      business vitality should be employed in commercial areas where
      preservation of existing businesses of value to the community.
